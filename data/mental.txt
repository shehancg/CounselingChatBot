Difficulty concentrating, making decisions, or remembering things can make daily functioning challenging. Thoughts of death or suicide may be present in severe cases.

Anxiety disorders encompass a range of conditions that involve excessive worry or fear that is difficult to control. Individuals may feel restless or constantly on edge. Panic attacks, characterized by intense fear and accompanied by physical symptoms like a rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and sweating, may occur.

Irritability, difficulty concentrating, or trouble sleeping are additional symptoms associated with anxiety disorders.

Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by distinct episodes of mania and depression. During manic episodes, individuals may experience an elevated mood, increased energy, racing thoughts, and engage in impulsive behavior.

Changes in sleep patterns, appetite, and irritability are commonly observed. Poor judgment or engaging in risk-taking behavior during manic episodes is also a key symptom.

Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder characterized by a combination of symptoms.

Problems with memory, attention, and concentration can significantly impact daily functioning.

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder that involves recurring, intrusive thoughts or obsessions.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Individuals with PTSD may have intrusive memories or flashbacks of the traumatic event, causing distressing emotions and physical sensations. Avoidance of triggers associated with the trauma is common, and individuals may try to avoid reminders of the event, including people, places, or activities. Negative changes in thoughts and mood can occur, such as persistent negative beliefs, feelings of guilt or shame, or a diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities. Hyperarousal symptoms like being easily startled, irritability, and difficulty sleeping are frequently experienced. Some individuals may also feel detached from others or have a sense of emotional numbness.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that typically begins in childhood and continues into adulthood.

Symptoms include a loss of interest or pleasure in activities, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, difficulty bonding with the baby, and frequent mood swings. Fatigue and lack of energy are common, making it challenging to cope with daily responsibilities. Some women may have intrusive thoughts related to harming themselves or the baby, though it's important to note that these thoughts are distressing and not indicative of actual intent. Postpartum depression requires professional support to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the baby.

Physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, and nausea can occur before or during social encounters. Individuals with SAD often have low self-esteem and a persistent fear of being negatively evaluated by others. This fear can significantly impact their personal and professional lives, leading to social isolation and decreased quality of life.
